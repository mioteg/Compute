# Scalable Compute in Azure
This session equips the Solution Architect with essential knowledge to leverage scalable and elastic compute in the Azure platform provides.
Learn what it takes to create scalable, fault tolerant, distributed applications using Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) and Microservices Architecture.
See how VMSS works and learn how it relates to other services in the Azure platform.
Learn how you can run applications using Docker containers in Azure Container Service.
Become familiar with Service Fabric, which runs many services in the Azure platform, and learn how to build your own applications using Service Fabric.
